            <h1>The journey</h1>
            <p className="home__text">Back in 2001, as a young kid, I started playing with animals and soon i realised my love towards cats. Since then, I started raising street cats in India. We see a lot of helpless animals such as cats and dogs wandering on the streets for food, shelter and some love. I felt heartbroken seeing the fate of these friendly animals. <br></br> So, as I grew old, I know I could do something for them. So I started a non profit organization for my buddies in need of a house and love.
            I wanted to grow my reach so I started this website to let people know about the situation of cats and to adopt these cats, this is the right destination. Please feel free to explore the website. </p>
